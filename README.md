# Giovanni-python-data-science

Python fundamentals for data science and data analysis.  
This repository contains scripts and small projects developed to build a solid foundation in Python and to showcase my profile as an aspiring data analyst / data scientist.

## Overview

This repository documents my learning process in Python with a clear focus on data science and data analysis.  
In addition to fundamental concepts, it includes small, practical projects designed to demonstrate real data workflows and analytical thinking.

The goal is not only to learn Python, but also to build a portfolio that reflects my technical growth and problem-solving approach.

## Topics Covered

- Core Python syntax
- Variables and data types
- Lists and basic data structures
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions

## Projects

The `projects/` folder contains small data science projects, including:
- Linear regression examples
- Multiple linear regression using CSV datasets
- Data exploration and visualization workflows

These projects are intentionally simple and focused, aiming to demonstrate clarity, structure, and understanding rather than complexity.

## Approach

- Practical, data-oriented examples
- Incremental learning through daily scripts
- Emphasis on understanding data workflows and modeling logic
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code

## Goal

Build a strong Python foundation and progressively develop data analysis and data science projects to support a professional transition into a technical, data-focused role.
